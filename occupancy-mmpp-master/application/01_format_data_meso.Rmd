*working with an Rmarkdown file because it's easier to take notes like this
to work with this code, I need the following as data:
covs: covariates for each deployment (row for every site, all covariates in columns)
dets: every detection in a row, with columns for when the camera was put out and what was detected
coys and deer: list of length matching total deployments, gets filled in with detections for each species
dt: date-time object with the date-time of every detection across all deployments

and the following values:
coys_ind: indices of coyote detections (not actually sure why this is 33)
deer_ind: same thing for deer, again not sure why this is 8 10
dep_len: list with how long is each deployment (in days)
dep_start:list with start date/time of each deployment in a certain format
deps: list with all deployment IDs
i: index of all deployments (I think)
ind: not sure
sits_cov: list of all the sites that have covariates
sits_det: list of all the sites that have detections

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
