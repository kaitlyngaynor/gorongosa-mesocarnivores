Collecting and annotating scripts for running occuMulti, an R function that fits Rota's model.

**Might be easier for you to start with the links I sent you, and then look at my thoughts in here? Sorry, it's rather long

my sources: https://rdrr.io/cran/unmarked/man/occuMulti.html and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/unmarked/unmarked.pdf

#install package
```{r}
library("unmarked") #install.packages("unmarked")
```

## occuMulti
uses unmarkedFrameOccuMulti to receive data, notes below
```{r}
occuMulti(detformulas, stateformulas, data, maxOrder, starts, method="BFGS",
    se=TRUE, engine=c("C","R"), silent=FALSE, ...)
```
detformulas     Character vector of formulas for the detection models, one per species. 

^^from the pdf: Independent detection models (potentially containing different covariates) must be provided for
each species with the detformulas argument, which takes a character vector of individual formulas with length equal to the number of species s.

#so this would be how we want the detection covariates to be considered? I think these have a bunch of '~1's in them, which means you're suggesting a constant relationship?

stateformulas     Character vector of formulas for the natural parameters. To fix a natural parameter at 0, specify the corresponding formula as "0" or "~0". 

^^from the pdf: The natural parameters can then be modeled as linear functions of covariates. Covariates for each f
must be specified with the stateformulas argument, which takes a character vector of individual formulas of length equal to the number of natural parameters (which in turn depends on the number of species in the model).

#I think natural parameters = f1, f2, f12, etc -- the formulas that include which factors we believe will affect occupancy. which can vary among species

data     An unmarkedFrameOccuMulti object 
#notes below on how to create this

maxOrder     Optional; specify maximum interaction order. Defaults to number of species (all possible interactions). Reducing this value may speed up optimization if you arenâ€™t interested in higher-order interactions. 
#we're only planning to consider pairwise interactions, right? so the maximum interaction order we'd be interested in is 2?

starts     Vector of parameter starting values.
#not sure what this is
#could this be the first replicate survey at each site? that's something the stan code uses

method     Optimization method used by optim.
#should be "BFGS"?
#Method "BFGS" is a quasi-Newton method (also known as a variable metric algorithm), specifically that published simultaneously in 1970 by Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno. This uses function values and gradients to build up a picture of the surface to be optimized.

se     Logical specifying whether or not to compute standard errors.

engine     Either "C" to use fast C++ code or "R" to use native R code during the optimization.

silent     Boolean; if TRUE, suppress warnings. 
#this sounds rather ominous

#example code for occuMulti
```{r}
## Not run:
#Simulate 3 species data
N <- 1000 #number of cameras? (in other places that's called M)
nspecies <- 3 #often given an 'S', number of species
J <- 5 #max number of sampling days per site

#occ_covs has 1000 rows, 10 columns; I think the 10 is the number of occupancy covariates, and the 1000 might be the number of cameras?
#rnorm generates random deviates (deviate: the value of a random variable measured from some standard point of location, usually the mean)
occ_covs <- as.data.frame(matrix(rnorm(N*10),ncol=10))
names(occ_covs) <- paste('occ_cov',1:10,sep='') #this names the columns
det_covs <- list() #creates an empty list

#N*J is the total number of observations
#for each species, create a matrix with a row for each camera and a column for each day (so 3 matrices in this example)
for (i in 1:nspecies){
det_covs[[i]] <- matrix(rnorm(N*J),nrow=N) 
} #filling in the detection covariates for each species?

names(det_covs) <- paste('det_cov',1:nspecies,sep='') #names the matrices

#True vals
##why is this arbitrarily assigning beta values? 
#10 items, for the 10 occupancy covariates?
beta <- c(0.5,0.2,0.4,0.5,-0.1,-0.3,0.2,0.1,-1,0.1) 

#assuming these are the natural parameter functions, but not sure which relates to which species/species combo
#though that might be answered manually below
#Peter: this is just them providing the "true" values which then they can test the model against (so part of the simulation and not something I need to do to run the model)

f7 <- beta[10]
f <- cbind(f1,f2,f3,f4,f5,f6,f7) #1000 rows, 7 columns
#creates a table with 8 rows (possible species combos, I think--2^3) and 3 columns, one for each species
#only 0 or 1 entries
z <- expand.grid(rep(list(1:0),nspecies))[,nspecies:1]
colnames(z) <- paste('sp',1:nspecies,sep='') #names the columns in z

#paste0()converts its arguments to character strings and concatenates them
#this creates a spreadsheet with columns for sp 1, sp 2, sp 3, sp 1:sp 2, sp 1:sp 3, sp 2:sp 3, sp 1:sp 2:sp 3, which seems promising? 7 columns (for each f) and 8 rows (for each spp combo)
#all entries are 1 or 0
#model.matrix creates a design (or model) matrix, e.g., by expanding factors to a set of dummy variables (depending on the contrasts) and expanding interactions similarly.
#this is the design matrix?!
#Peter: rows are all species presence/absence combinations, columns are: each species(3), each possible pair(3), and all 3; with a 1 in the cell if all the species in the corresponding species combination are included in the column header --> a truth table

psi <- psi/rowSums(psi) #Peter:probability of each different species combo (because we're simulating data, we just make that up)

#True state
#makes an empty matrix
#Peter: ztruth is just being used to create the fake detection histories; math to make a detection history for each species that matches your proposed psi

}

## unmarkedFrameOccuMulti
```{r}
unmarkedFrameOccuMulti(y, siteCovs=NULL, obsCovs=NULL,
maxOrder, mapInfo)

```
arguments:
y     A list (optionally a named list) of length S where each element is an MxJ matrix of the detection, non-detection data for one species, where M is the number of sites, J is the maximum number of sampling periods per site, and S is the number of species in the analysis. 
#this corresponds to our detection histories

siteCovs     A data.frame of covariates that vary at the site level. This should have M rows and one column per covariate 
#cool, this is the psi and p covariate sheets, not sure how you tell it which one is for occupancy vs detection probabilities (unless it's only the occupancy-related covariates, and there's another way of incorporating the detection ones?)

obsCovs     Either a named list of data.frames of covariates that vary within sites, or a data.frame with MxJ rows in site-major order. 
#no idea. what type of covariate would vary within a site? I think this would be NULL for our data. 
#Unless these are the detection covariates? some hint of that, maybe, above (where it names obsCovs = det_covs when running occuMulti)

maxOrder     Optional; specify maximum interaction order. Defaults to number of species (all possible interactions). Reducing this value may speed up creation of unmarked frame if you arenâ€™t interested in higher-order interactions.
#comment above 

mapInfo     Currently ignored

#example code for unmarkedFramOccuMulti
```{r }
# Fake data
S <- 3 # number of species
M <- 4 # number of sites
J <- 3 # number of visits

#is the below code just creating a matrix for use? with made up data
y <- list(matrix(rbinom(M*J,1,0.5),M,J), # species 1
matrix(rbinom(M*J,1,0.5),M,J), # species 2
matrix(rbinom(M*J,1,0.2),M,J)) # species 3
site.covs <- data.frame(x1=1:4, x2=factor(c('A','B','A','B')))
site.covs #4 rows (number of sites) x 2 columns (2 covariates?)
umf <- unmarkedFrameOccuMulti(y=y, siteCovs=site.covs,
obsCovs=NULL) # organize data
umf # look at data
summary(umf) # summarize
plot(umf) # visualize
