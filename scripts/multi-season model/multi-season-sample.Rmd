#install packages (starting with these because they seem like a good group)
```{r}
library("unmarked")  #install.packages("unmarked") 
library(camtrapR) #install.packages("camtrapR")
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(patchwork) #install.packages("patchwork")
library(ggpubr)  #install.packages("ggpubr")
```

## get sample data

```{r}
crossbill_dh <- read_csv(data(crossbill))
colnames(crossbill)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
